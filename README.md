# PrioritizationGUI (2/3 complete)
just a quick test program as I mess around with imgui, although thats not to say this program lacks utility for simple task prioritization.

This program is targetted towards those who want to prioritize there academic or recreational lifes.
The way it works is there are a set of values with differing weights that are to apply to each task

an overall score is assigned using these values for each task and given a priority percentage comparative to the rest of 
the assignments.

You can edit the Tasks and there enumerations for each value on the Edit->Tasks page.

when a task is completed the user can check the checkbox which will instantly update the rankings.
Note: for satisfaction the percentage is color cordinated, the closer to red being of higher priority'

lastly for those of you who really like customization you can also modify the enumerations float value,
visually depicted as this graph, making it more steep, flatter, perhaps plateaued in the center, exeggerate the end, etc
